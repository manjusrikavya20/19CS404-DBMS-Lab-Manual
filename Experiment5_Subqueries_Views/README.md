# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## NAME: MANJUSRI KAVYA R
## REG.NO: 212224040186

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is EQUAL TO $1500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY = 1500;
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all orders generated by the salespeople who may work for customers whose id is 3007. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

Table Name: orders

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE salesman_id = (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = 3007
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $1500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

```sql
select*
from CUSTOMERS
where salary>1500;
```

**Output:**

```sql
select * from CUSTOMERS where ADDRESS ='Delhi' and AGE<30
order by ID;
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to determine the commission of the salespeople in Paris. Return commission.

    WHERE city = 'Paris'
);
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query to Identify customers whose city is different from the city of the customer with the highest ID

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE city <> (
    SELECT city
    FROM customer
    WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM customer)
);
```

**Output:**



**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)
<img width="694" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea225702-dc7a-4ce1-b5b7-5150bea6c20a" />




```sql
SELECT student_name, grade
FROM grades g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MAX(grade)
    FROM grades
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);
```

**Output:**

<img width="779" height="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56603a45-b81b-4743-9318-af0d83d40913" />


**Question 8**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the all the columns from the Table Grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM grades g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MIN(grade)
    FROM grades
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);
```

**Output:**

<img width="1266" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a803f53-b802-4dfc-9403-ba11431d5977" />

**Question 9**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the names and cities of customers who have the same city as customers with IDs 3 and 7

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

```sql
SELECT name, city

WHERE city IN (
    SELECT city
    FROM customer
    WHERE id IN (3, 7)
);

```

**Output:**

<img width="621" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d7044d2-144d-497d-aca2-4e066ba96630" />
